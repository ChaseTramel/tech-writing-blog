Hello there! I’m Chase Tramel, your friend in demystifying the complex world of technology through the art of technical writing. I've always been fascinated by how technology connects people, ideas, and solutions.

Why technical writing, you ask? Well, it’s simple. I adore the challenge of breaking down intricate tech concepts into digestible, engaging stories. Whether it’s explaining the nuts and bolts of web development or guiding you through the complexities of content management systems, I'm here to make your tech journey smoother and more understandable.

## Here’s a little more about me:

Technology: With a solid foundation in front-end development and an insatiable curiosity for all things tech, I’ve honed my ability to translate code into conversations. My secret weapon? Markdown! It’s not just a syntax for me; it’s a way to craft stories that resonate.

Git & GitHub: Version control is amazing. I thrive on the collaborative spirit of GitHub. It's where my project management skills really shine, keeping everything organized and moving forward.
M
Event Host and WordPress Wizard: From orchestrating events that bring communities together to managing WordPress websites with a flair for design, I've got the knack for creating experiences online and offline that are memorable and engaging.

Community Builder: Whether it’s leading a team of volunteers at an animal shelter or managing a bustling Discord server, I believe in the power of community. It’s all about connecting, sharing, and growing together.

## My Journey

My path has been anything but ordinary. From tutoring students at Eastern Florida State College to being an event planner, website manager, and even a game room manager, every experience has enriched my understanding of how people interact with technology. Along the way, I've picked up a couple of accolades, like the Citizen Scholar Honor and the Provost Personal Achievement Award, which remind me that hard work and dedication never go unnoticed.

Looking Forward:

As I continue my adventure in the tech world, I’m always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn and grow. My personal journey is proof that my belief that with the right words, any technical concept can become accessible and engaging.
